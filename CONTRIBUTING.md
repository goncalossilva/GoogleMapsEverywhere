When submitting your code, make every effort to follow existing conventions and style in order to keep the code as readable as possible.

The goal is to follow the Google Maps Android API v2 as much as possible. With this in mind, there are many areas that need work:

1. Extending the supported APIs
2. Refactoring the strcuture to hide the internal APIs from the final user
3. Improve local caching.
