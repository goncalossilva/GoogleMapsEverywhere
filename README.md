# GoogleMapsEveywhere

GoogleMapsEverywhere facilitates the use of Google Maps on Android devices that don't have or don't support the Google Play Services.

Internally, it's a wrapper around the Google Maps JavaScript API v3.

## Usage

For the most part, the API is the same as Google Maps Android API v2, so the documentation for it applies.
