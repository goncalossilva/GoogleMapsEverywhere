# GoogleMapsEveywhere

GoogleMapsEverywhere facilitates the use of Google Maps on Android devices that don't have or don't support the Google Play Services.

Internally, it's a wrapper around the Google Maps JavaScript API v3.

## Usage

For the most part, the API is the same as Google Maps Android API v2, so the documentation for it applies.

The API key must be specified in your AndroidManifest.xml, like this:

    <meta-data
        android:name="com.google.android.maps.v3.API_KEY"
        android:value="YOUR_API_KEY" />

It should be a regular Google Maps JavaScript API v3.

Unlike Google Maps on Android, GoogleMapsEverywhere doesn't need any special permission to run besides the `android.permission.INTERNET` permission, which is required by its own `AndroidManifest.xml`. However, if you use `GoogleMap#setMyLocationEnabled(true)` you'll need to declare the `android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file.
